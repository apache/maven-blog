The new release of the [Apache Maven Deploy Plugin 2.8.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/)
contains two bug fixes:

Fixed bugs:

* [MDEPLOY-169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MDEPLOY-169) - deployAtEnd broken with parallel builds
* [MDEPLOY-170](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MDEPLOY-170) - Plugin configuration on module level is ignored when deployAtEnd

Thanks to the Maven Team.
